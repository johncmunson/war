### Javascript Game of War

This is a simple command line game I created to strengthen my knowledge of
Javascript ES6 and object oriented programming.

###### To run the game:
1. Make sure node.js is installed
2. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
3. Run `$ node war.js`

###### To-Do:
- Add more command line interactivity
- Create an npm package
- Ability to configure the game with command line flags
- Better round summaries in the console output
- Maybe add ASCII art
- Add a separate branch for "classic javascript"
- This branch only demonstrates composition,
  so I could add a branch that also demonstrates inheritance
- Unit tests
- Have someone else review if there is anything that could be more "OOP"
- Bonus: server, database, frontend
	- Websockets or WebRTC, JSON RPC, JSON Schema
	- Gambling or advertisements
	- Play vs others or the computer
	- Create a core game/rules engine, that could power other types of card games
