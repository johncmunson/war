### Game of War

This is a simple command line game I created to strengthen my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, as well as Javascript and other programming languages. There is currently a working implementation for Javascript in the `javascript-es6` directory. Ruby is a work in progress, with other languages like Python and Java coming in the future.

###### Running the game:

Check the language specific repos for instructions on running the game in the language you are most interested in.

###### To-Do / Ideas:

- Implement a solution in languages other than Javascript (Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, Coffeescript, Clojurescript, etc.)
- Implement a solution in "classic javascript"
- This current javascript solution only demonstrates composition, so I could add a branch that also demonstrates inheritance
- Implement the [Actor Model](https://monades.roperzh.com/get-to-know-the-actor-model/) design pattern
- Add more command line interactivity
- Ability to configure the game with command line flags
- Turn it into a learning game (i.e. learn javascript by playing war!)
- Create an npm package, or a ruby gem
- Better round summaries in the console output
- Maybe add ASCII art
- Unit tests
- Have someone else review if there is anything that could be more "OOP"
- Bonus: server, database, frontend
	- Websockets, JSON RPC, JSON Schema
	- Gambling or advertisements
	- Play vs others or the computer
	- Create a core game/rules engine, that could power other types of card games
